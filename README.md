AS A marketing agency <br/>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines <br/>
While following this I tasked myself to do a few things
to make the site run more smoothly and efficiently
First alt descriptions were needed for each<br/>
and every picture used.
Secondly needed to alter some of the elements used 
in the code to semantic ones so anyone could <br/>
follow along better.
Another thing was the style sheet had a bunch of 
duplicates so it made things better to look at by
compiling the same styles
